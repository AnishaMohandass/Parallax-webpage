            In itself, jewellery has no other purpose than to look attractive. However, it is often added to items that have a practical 
            function. Items such as belts and handbags are mainly accessories but may be decorated. A broach, often worn to keep a cloak 
            closed, could be highly decorated with jewels.</p>

            angles to each other to form cloth. Weaving is usually done on a loom. One set of threads is called the warp. These 
            threads are held taut and in parallel order on the loom by harnesses creating a space called the shed. The weft thread 
            is wound onto bobbins. The bobbins are held in a shuttle, which carries the weft thread through the shed. The warp threads 
            are moved over and under the weft threads.</p>
